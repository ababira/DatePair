# DateTime & DatePair


### Installation

1. Install the widget in your project
2. Include the **DateTime** widget on a page where you'd like to display an independent date and time picker for a Datetime attribute. Include the **DatePair** widget on a page where you'd like to display a linked pair of Datetime attributes (i.e. a start and end datetime, for appointments, etc)
3. Configure the widget:

+ `breakpoint` : Screen width (in pixels) to split between the large number of items and the small number
+ `Large Number` : Number of tabs to show above the breakpoint
+ `Small Number` : Number of tabs to show below the breakpoint
+ `Tabs Class (To Add)` : Add a class to the bar of tab headings
